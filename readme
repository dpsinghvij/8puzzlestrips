Details:
I have made some tweaks in STRIPS knowledge base for scenarios in which we had to swap a number with zero
as during these scenarios it is necessary to save the last state of the number instead of clearing it directly
as it is done in other scenarios For these scenarios, I have replaced clear method with On method which instead of clearing
the value, saves previous value at location where 0 was located. Also a precondition of zero has been removed
